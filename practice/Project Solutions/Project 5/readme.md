This project has two proposed solutions.
One is OOP style using a BST class and a Node class.
One is one is Functional style using a list-of-lists representation.

Both solutions use recursion with nested helper functions,
which is most natural.
A third solution, not implemented, is to use a fixed-size array or list
with children at appropriate indices.
