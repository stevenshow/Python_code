Create a threading script that downloads x amount of images from unsplash based on search parameters.  Process those images and get only the ones that are suitable for a desktop background.  Set the desktop background.  Do this everyday at x time.
Possibly run a script after the photos have been downloaded that switches the background to one of the pictures in the folder.
